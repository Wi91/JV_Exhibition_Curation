# JV_Exhibition_Curation

# Museo Backend API

## About

**Museo** is a backend API service designed to power a frontend Android application that lets users explore and curate art collections. It integrates with two external museum/art collection APIs to fetch data on artworks and exhibitions. Users can create custom exhibitions and save individual artworks within them, enabling personalized curation experiences.


- Integration with external museum APIs for rich art data.
- Support for user-generated custom exhibitions.
- Scalable RESTful API design for seamless frontend consumption.

## Dependencies

Museo is built using **Spring Boot** and relies on several key libraries and frameworks:

| Dependency                      | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `spring-boot-starter-web`       | Provides core web functionalities including RESTful API support.        |
| `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`  | Enables integration with relational databases via JPA and Hibernate.    |
| `spring-boot-starter-test`      | Includes testing libraries for unit and integration tests (JUnit, etc). |
| `h2`                            | In-memory database used for development and testing.                    |
| `postgresql`                    | PostgreSQL driver for production-level relational database access.     |
| `lombok`                        | Reduces boilerplate code by auto-generating getters, setters, etc.     |
| `hibernate-validator`           | Provides validation framework for request data using annotations.       |

> Java version used: **21**  
> Spring Boot version: **3.4.5**

## Link to App

## Base URL

The API base URL for all endpoints is:

`/api/v1/museo`

For local development, the full base URL is:

`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/museo`

> This is the default path unless configured differently in the application settings.



## Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with the base URL:
